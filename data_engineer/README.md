# Data engineer workshop
## Objective
The objective of the Data Engineering workshop was to demonstrate the process of handling data, including data collection, cleansing, and transformation using tools like Spark. The goal was to provide hands-on experience in preparing raw data for analysis by going through the necessary steps to clean and format the data appropriately.

## Step
Environment Setup:
Data Collection:
Data Cleansing:
Data Transformation:
Result Compilation:
## Result
The workshop concluded with a set of cleaned and transformed data, ready for further analysis. The results might include a well-formatted dataset free from inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant information. Depending on the specific exercises, there might also be some insights or summaries generated as part of the final output.

## Documentation
Data Collection.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook likely contains code and explanations related to the first workshop focused on data collection. It includes steps to read, explore, and store the data collected from various sources.

env.txt: This text file may contain environment configuration details, such as the list of libraries or dependencies required to run the workshop's code.

output.csv: The output CSV file might contain the processed data resulting from the first workshop's data collection efforts.

complete_workshop_two: This file, depending on its format, could include the complete code or documentation related to the second workshop, covering data cleansing and transformation.

Online Retail WS2.csv: This CSV file contains raw retail data used in the second workshop for data cleansing exercises.

Data Cleansing with Spark: This Jupyter notebook (or script) likely contains the code and steps related to the second workshop, focusing on data cleansing using Spark.
